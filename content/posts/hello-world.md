Welcome to my new blog powered by Zola!

This is a minimalist theme with (nearly) no CSS, focusing on fast loading and clean content.

## Getting Started

To add new posts, create markdown files in the `content/` directory with front matter like this:

```
+++
title = "My Post Title"
date = 2025-12-18
+++

Your content here...
```

## Building and Serving

- Build: `zola build`
- Serve locally: `zola serve`
- Deploy: The `public/` directory contains your static site
